[MR_Point] You really are a star customer, kid. You've bought my entire catalogue!
[MR_Normal] I don't have anything else to sell, but I'll have more for you when I've finally got a place to settle down.
[MR_Happy] Hell, I might give you a discount! Least I can do.
[MR_Normal] Keep an eye out for me in the future.
[PP_Normal] I'll keep that noted. See you around, I guess...
