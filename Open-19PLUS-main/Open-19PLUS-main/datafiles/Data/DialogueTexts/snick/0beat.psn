[SK_Happy] Hi Peppino! Thanks for accepting my invitation to test out some Snicksoft games. How come it took you so long?
[PP_Bored] Oh, er, you know how it's like in the business, lots of customers...
[PP_Bored] Plus I have to keep the rent paid, it's uh, hard to make time for everything.
[SK_Normal] I don't remember you ever saying you paid rent. Oh well, doesn't matter.
[SK_Normal] We've got the games up and running, feel free to test them out.
[SK_Normal] And let me know if you encounter any game-breaking bugs. You're the fast type, and we're kind of hitting crunch time, so I thought you'd be best for the job.
[SK_Happy] Have fun!
