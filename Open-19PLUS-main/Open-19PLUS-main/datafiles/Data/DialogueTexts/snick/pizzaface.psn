[PP_Normal] Hey Snick, I've uh, got a bug to report.
[SK_Confused] Wait, really?
[PP_Angry] Yeah, a giant monstrous mass of pixels appeared out of nothing and started chasing me. Can you please explain to me what the HELL that was about!?
[SK_Normal] Oh, that's weird. Did you run out of time?
[PP_Bored] Yes. Why?
[SK_Confused] Huh. Yeah, that's the punishment for running out of time, something's supposed to show up and chase you. But he's not meant to look like a buggy mass of pixels...
[SK_Normal] Eh, who cares. The modders'll fix it and we'll put it in the game as an update. No worries.
[SK_Happy] Next time something scary is chasing you, be assured that's HALF-intentional. It's PROBABLY not a demon stuck in the game.
[PP_Bored] Yeah, thanks.
