# Ice Pop's Dialogue
# Default Line (Can Be Overridden)
"icepop_hub_default" : "I'll give you my cigar, if I can have yours!"

# Default Escape Line (Currently Hardcoded)
"icepop_default_escape" : "HOLY MOLY!!"

# Tutorial Dialogue
"icepop_tut_1" : "Ho ho! Hello there, kiddo, I'm your Ice-Pop! I'm here to teach you some new things you should know! Before that though, I just want you to try making it through this room real quick. No sweat, right?"
"icepop_tut_2" : "Usually, there's little candy creatures in these things, but I put my annoying grandchildren in them instead! Make sure to grab 'em if ya see 'em."
"icepop_tut_3" : "Those pesky jawbreakers in the way? Not to worry! Your Super Jump [kSJ] can smash right through those tough blocks! You can also adjust yourself slightly left or right while going up."
"icepop_tut_4" : "Tally Ho! My egg of a son, Ice Pop, won't tell you this, but I, Grandpa Cone, will. A lass like yourself can hover in the air with [kG]. Pressing it twice will do a cool roll attack!"
"icepop_tut_5" : "With enough speed from your Mach Run, you can press [kD] to slide through jawbreakers! Go ahead kiddo, try it out!"
"icepop_tut_6" : "If you press [kJ] while you're scootin' up a wall, you'll be able to wallkick off of it and move freely! This can break weaker blocks. When you land, this will boost you forward if you keep [kM] held!"
"icepop_tut_7" : "While you're doing a wallkick, press [kD] to quickly fall down! Go get 'em sport!"
"icepop_tut_8" : "Oh, I just remembered! If you ever see /1 Rudy, go and say hi to him for me! He's got keys for all the locked doors around here, I'm sure he'll letcha in if you ask nicely. I know how much you youngsters love collecting trinkets and such..."
"icepop_tut_9" : "That big gummy guy over there is /1 Harry. If you smack him, the door you came in from will open again! Once that happens, you had better scoot your way back quickly. If you're fast enough, you can pay a visit to /2 Polka and go 'round again, /3 ya silly sprat!"
"icepop_tut_10" : "During a wallkick, press [kG] while midair to cancel it into a Mach Run! You can use this to break Jawbreaker blocks!"


# Painter's Demo Dialogue
# Painter is supposed to be French, hence all the French/French-derived words and odd sentence structure.
# Main Hub Dialogue
"demopainter_newfile"        : "Hmm... You are the one who scattered my precious /1 INK! The Critics are already en route... you had better bring my INK back to me before they arrive."
"demopainter_nosecrets"      : "Hmm... My patience is shrinking, tiny candy lady. Find my /1 INK."
"demopainter_fewsecrets"     : "Hmm... I see you have started to return some of my /1 INK, but there is still more left. There is little time for us to chit the chat, I'm afraid, I'm much too busy preparing the show..."
"demopainter_3secrets"       : "Hmm... Did you see them? Look at their beady little eyes... They think they can critique me? MOI? Hmph."
"demopainter_6secrets"       : "Hmm... You're halfway there, confiseur, but please hurry. If they are kept waiting any longer, the Critics are sure to pen a scathing critique of me in one of those free magazines you find on airplanes..."
"demopainter_9secrets"       : "Hmm... Perhaps I judged you too harshly, confiseur. The Critics seem to appreciate your roguish smile and lovable antics..."
"demopainter_allsecrets"     : "Hmm... Finally, you've recovered all of my /1 INK! Please, mademoiselle, enjoy the show."
"demopainter_invalidsecrets" : "Hmm... There is something to be said for the strange connection which any interactive art has to its host medium. Even the most well-preserved copy of Madden NFL 2001 is only as good as the PlayStation 2 upon which it runs, or as pure as the intentions of one who runs it... You understand, right?"

# Dialogue for After the Allotted 1 Hour of Playtime
"demopainter_overtimeallsecrets"    : "Hmm... Your time at the exhibition may have expired, Confiseur, but I implore you to enjoy the art for as long as you wish! You have done me a great service, and it is no shellac off my back if you wish to stay a little longer."
"demopainter_overtimenotallsecrets" : "Hmm... You may have bought a ticket, Confiseur, but you are only owed 60 short minutes from moi. Your unhelpful behind had better make itself scarce before someone notices that your time is up..."


# Molasses Room Dialogue
# This is placeholder for now, unsure if we need a line for this.
"demopainter_molasses"              : "No! Not The Frog too! Now all of my paintings are ruined..."
"demopainter_molasses_gotsecrets_a" : "Hmm... My beautiful The Frog, at last you have been restored to your former glory! I promise never to take my eye off of you again..."
"demopainter_molasses_gotsecrets_b" : "Hmm... I'm impressed to see such refinement to your tastes, confiseur. You know, this piece is my Magnum Oculus, so I'm not surprised that you gravitated towards it so strongly."
"demopainter_molasses_sleeping"     : "Zzz... A starving artist like me needs his beauty sleep too..."


# Holiday Dialogue
"demopainter_newyears"   : "Hmm... I don't really understand what all the fuss is about. I can hardly see anything through these glasses..."
"demopainter_valentines" : "Hmm... All the cards at the store say things like \"I love you\" and \"You're special.\" Where's the card that says \"I admire your original compositions and appreciate their deeper subtextual meaning?\" I wish someone would get me one of those instead..."


# Small Thoughts
"demopainter_thoughtbuffer"  : "Hmm..."
"demopainter_idlethought_1"  : "Hmm... \"Art block\"?\nCall it art curse!\nThat's what it is..."
"demopainter_idlethought_2"  : "Hmm... If it all goes\nwrong, I can always\nreturn to jock life..."
"demopainter_idlethought_3"  : "Hmm... Maybe this will\nfinally get people off\ntheir phones..."
"demopainter_idlethought_4"  : "Hmm... Does the dry\ncleaner handle magic ink?\nOr just normal ink?"
"demopainter_idlethought_5"  : "Hmm... The bathroom\ndidn't arrive in time.\nI hope noone noticed."
"demopainter_idlethought_6"  : "Hmm... I wonder if\nI could write a\nbook about this..."


# Critic Dialogue
"democritic_1_d" : "Ah... This painting\nbelongs in the trash..."
"democritic_1_c" : "Ah... It's...\nsomething..."
"democritic_1_b" : "Ah... It seems\nto insist upon itself..."
"democritic_1_a" : "Ah... Interesting\nbrushwork..."
"democritic_1_s" : "Ah... This piece is\ndelightfully abstract..."
"democritic_1_p" : "Ah... I get it now!"

"democritic_2_d" : "Er... The Painter seems to\nhave missed a spot..."
"democritic_2_c" : "Er... Looks weird..."
"democritic_2_b" : "Er... What is this...\nSome Gum...?"
"democritic_2_a" : "Er... This works..."
"democritic_2_s" : "Er... It's rather\nerudite."
"democritic_2_p" : "Er... It's too good,\neven for me!"

"democritic_3_d" : "Umm... Looks too...\n\"anime?\""
"democritic_3_c" : "Umm... Would be better\nif The Painter\ndrew me instead!"
"democritic_3_b" : "Umm... I could have\ndrawn this better..."
"democritic_3_a" : "Umm... Interesting style,\nI suppose..."
"democritic_3_s" : "Umm... The colors here\nare immaculate!"
"democritic_3_p" : "Umm... I can't take my\neyes off this piece!"

"democritic_4_d" : "Oui... This thumb here\nappears to be backwards..."
"democritic_4_c" : "Oui... A child could\ndraw this..."
"democritic_4_b" : "Oui... Needs more shading..."
"democritic_4_a" : "Oui... It's \"fine\", but\nnot \"fine art\"..."
"democritic_4_s" : "Oui... This piece is\nquite delectable..."
"democritic_4_p" : "Oui... C'est trop beau\npour mes propres\nyeux!"

"democritic_icepop" : "That's right... I, Grandpa Cone, did quite\na good job, didn't I?"
