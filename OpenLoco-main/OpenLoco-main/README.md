# OpenLoco
A Decompilation of Loco Tower, including a FMOD Recreation

GameMaker Version Used: ```2024.6.2.162```

### ABOUT
This Decompilation is for the latest publicly available build of the game (the leaked August 2024 build)
<br>
And is completely Organized, along with proper Enums States for the player and enemies, and anywhere else where the original game uses them

I do plan on reviewing ALL of the game's code to ensure it's basically a flawless decompilation
<br>
But that has not been done yet

Some Crashes from the original leaked build have been fixed
<br>
Such as the Plane Crash and the Credits Crash
<br>
But any other issues have not been fixed

### About the FMOD Project
A FMOD Project is also Included within this Repository

And all Events have their respective sounds within them already, so you could just compile and use it
<br>
However, it is pretty bad in its current state, and still needs some work in order to function as well as the original
<br>
and I'm just not good with FMOD, so that's for someone else to do unfortunately

Hopefully this attempted recreation can be a good base for something better
<br>
Any Contributions are absolutely welcome

This was made possible thanks to my and CatMateo's [FMOD Decompiler](https://github.com/stuttermess/FMOD-Decompiler/)
