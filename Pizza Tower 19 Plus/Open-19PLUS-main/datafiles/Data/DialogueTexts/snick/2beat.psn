[SK_Happy] Wow, you're really good at this! Keep up the good work, and we'll be hitting store shelves in no time!
[SK_Normal] I was actually thinking of just straight up lying about the money in the note I sent you, but after seeing how well you're handling this, I might just give you some pennies myself!
[PP_Angry] You BETTER not be lying, or I'll have your ugly little purple quills plucked off one by one and sprinkled all over a half-off pizza special...
[SK_Normal] Alright, alright. No need to get defensive. Its just how it's like in the game industry. Don't worry, I can get some coins from my bank account. Now get back to work!
