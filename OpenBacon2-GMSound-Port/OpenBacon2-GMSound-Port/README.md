# OpenBacon2
A Decompilation of the leaked Bacon2 build

GameMaker Version Used: ```2024.8.1.171```

### ABOUT
THIS BRANCH MAKES SOME PRETTY BIG MODIFICATIONS

Changes:
- Removed FMOD and replaced it with GMSound
- Removed Gameframe
- Fixed Startgate crash from the original build
	

This branch is basically just the source code for my bacon2 Web Port, and these changes were needed to make everything compatiable with that platform.
<br>
This should only be used if you're porting bacon2 to another platform, or if you just really dislike FMOD and/or Gameframe
