UnderTale Yellow Decompilation by burnedpopcorn180
(another one to add to the list)

GameMaker Version used: 2023.4.0.84

GMLive is present in the project, but is still currently using Decompiled Code, which isn't the best
This will probably not be changed, as it's not really a problem, and I dont use GMLive

scr_enums contains all Enum Declarations for the Project
It currently still uses UnderAnalyzer's Stock Enums, but it still works, so...

BIG ISSUES!

Steamworks (factory_2) Psyhics thing is completely fucked (obj_seesaw)
Code Lock doesn't show GUI (obj_factory_02_numpad)


SMALL ISSUES!

rm_dunes_30_old and rm_dunes_30 are MISSING, since they didn't decompile right
rm_dunes_30 has been """"faithfully"""" recreated from scratch in order to progress, but still, not the original

Some Snowdin Rooms have Tiles that are incorrectly placed
(Purely Visual Issue)

(rm_snowdin_19_yellow) Second IceCube Puzzle in Snowdin is fucked due to the pistons having a very
big collsion box

spr_snowdin_19_piston had its collison box flattened to make it possible to beat, but its a bad fix
change it back to automatic when fixed

Also, For any Physics Objects that crash, check if room enables pyhsics
