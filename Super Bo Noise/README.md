# ![Super Bo Noise](https://files.catbox.moe/hwr9hi.png)

This project is a **decompilation of Super Bo Noise v1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1**.  

This version has been adapted for a **port to the Nintendo Switch**.  

This should build without issues, tested on real hardware (AMS 1.9.5 FW 20.5.0)

## Current Issues

- Some sounds do not play at the correct volume.  
- Unpausing the game via the plus button will keep all instances deactivated.  
- Saving doesnt work. oops.
